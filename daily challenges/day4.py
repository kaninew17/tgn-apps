            * **BMI Doesn't Measure Body Fat Directly:** BMI is a simple ratio of weight to height. It doesn't distinguish between muscle, bone, or fat, which means a very muscular person can be classified as overweight or obese.
            * **Ignores Fat Distribution:** It doesn't account for where fat is stored. Abdominal fat is a greater health risk than fat stored elsewhere, and BMI can't detect this.
            * **Demographic Inaccuracies:** The standard BMI scale is not always accurate for all ethnic groups or age ranges. It is also unsuitable for specific populations like pregnant women.
            * **Not a Health Indicator:** A person's BMI doesn't necessarily reflect their overall health. Individuals with a "normal" BMI may have health issues, while someone with a high BMI could be very physically fit.
            * **Sarcopenia Misclassification:** BMI can underestimate body fat in older adults or people who have lost muscle mass, a condition called sarcopenia, because their total weight may be lower despite a higher percentage of body fat.
